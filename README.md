# Dashboard

:arrow_forward:  **[Live preview!](https://nekosoffy.github.io/dashboard/)**

This project is a dashboard website design implemented using HTML and CSS. The fictional website -- nicknamed Cutieboard -- features a social media-like interface where the user can interact with their own project notes, view the website's announcements and keep in touch with other users' updates. As this is a design version, the page has no funcionality, but the icons and links are properly clickable.

The design was mostly made with CSS grid, as practice, even though it's not the most optimal tool for every case. Very minimal flexbox properties were also used.
